In that post he also references Albert Rapp’s The ultimate guide to starting a Quarto blog. I’m sure I’ll follow up with lessons learned from this in time."

Because of this I enjoy understanding how systems function on a fundamental level, so there will undoubtably be some asides of that nature sprinkled throughout this blog."
